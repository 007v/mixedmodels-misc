Thoughts about design of statistical tools: what did R get right?
---

The [recent Moore foundation grant to Julia-lang](https://www.moore.org/newsroom/in-the-news/2015/11/10/bringing-julia-from-beta-to-1.0-to-support-data-intensive-scientific-computing) got me thinking about 

- update() with data by reference
- good and bad points of model matrices/frames/terms etc.
- terms objects - useful but not transparent
- evaluation in different environments
- simulate methods
- effects()/lsmeans equivalent
- formulas - flexible, not flexible enough?
- methods - intervals/confint, different parameter types, parameter
transformations, scaling/orthogonalization
- model types that can be separately defined and fitted
